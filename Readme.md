## Sentiment Analysis:
The practice of using computers to recognize sentiment or emotion expressed in a text. Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understanding customer needs.

In this project, I have:

	1. Created an AI based sentiment analysis application using Watson NLP embedded libraries.
	2. Formatted the output received from the Watson NLP library function to extract relevant information from it.
	3. Packaged the application and made it importable to any python code for usage.
	4. Ran unit tests on the application and checked the validity of its outputs for different inputs.
	5. Deployed the application using Flask framework.
	6. Incorporated error handling capability in the application, such that a response code of 500 receives an appropriate response from the application.
	7. Ran static code analysis on the code files to confirm their adherence to the PEP8 guidelines.
